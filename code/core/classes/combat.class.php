Combat Summary
==============

A combat round under the following rules is extremely simple

1. Determine whether Character hits the Creature opponent
2. Compute the Damage a Successfull hit causes
3. Apply the Damage.

1. Determine whether Character hits the Creature opponent
---------------------------------------------------------

a) we first calculate the creature's AC (Armour Class), i.e. a measure of how hard a creature is to hit. This is calculated as:
	Armour Base (10) + Armour Bonus (DB Value) + DEX Modifier (DB Value)
	where:
			-Base is a predetermined value, generally 10 (lower to make game more challenging - potent. Game Var)
			-Bonus comes from Armour/Equip, generally given a single value for creatures (simpler)
			-DEX Modifier - generally equals [ (DEX-10)/2 ] (other mods done in same way)
b) to hit the creature, the character must match the creature's AC score with an Attack Roll. The AR score is computed as:
	1d20 (RAND 1->20) + Attack Bonus
	where:
			-1d20 is a random number between 1 and 20 (scoring a 20 gives a CRITICAL HIT) (weapon critical range ignored for the moment - depending on weapon could be 19-20, 18-20, etc)
			-Attack Bonus equals [ Base Attack + STR Modifier ]
			-Base Attack is preset to 1, but will eventually equal Base Attack of the character's class at their current level once we implement classes properly in 0.0.5 or later. 

2. Compute the Damage a Successfull hit causes
----------------------------------------------

Damage is computed by reference to a characters weapons. Currently all weapons are deemed to do damage equal to 1d6, i.e. a random number between 1 and 6, and is computed by weapon as follows:
	DOUBLE WEAPON: 1D6 + (1.5 * STR Modifier)
	ON-HAND WEAPON: 1D6 + (1.0 * STR Modifier)
	OFF-HAND WEAPON: 1D6 + (0.5 * STR Modifier)
		where:
			DOUBLE is a weapon held in both hands, ON-HAND is a weapon held in the right hand, and OFF-HAND is a second weapon held in the left hand. Generally double/twin weapons give a multiplier of 1.5 where a single weapon provides a multiplier of 1 (unless a DOUBLE, e.g. two-ended weapon like a staff). In the future, using a double/two weapons will impose a penalty to balance the multiplier increase - this will be mitigated by certain SKILLS/FEATS once these are implemented.
				For this simplified combat system we ignore that using a DOUBLE or additional weapon actually should count as an extra attack, with a separate success check. Rather if first attack is a success, we assume second is also - and vice versa in event of a failure.

3. Apply the Damage.
--------------------

Damage is taken against the creatures "health", if this goes below zero - the character wins. 

Additionally, scoring a 20 on a d20 roll when calculating the Attack Roll (see above) will give an opportunity to score a CRITICAL HIT. Whether this becomes a critical hit depends on whether a SECOND Armour Class/Attack Roll is won by the player. If the second roll is won by the character - damage will normally be doubled (sometimes tripled - depends on weapon - though this simplified system ignore weapon ranges). If the character loses the second AR/AC test - they will still do normal damage. (note: we are also ignoring that any score of 20 from a d20 all is an automatic success - will implement this, and all the other steps/factors ignored in the simple combat system at a later date.)

The process for creatures attacking the character is essentially the same - :)


Development Notes:
-system as a whole is simplified (more detail to add)
-some values are explicitly given, where in future they would be calculated
-most calcs use attribute modifiers, a modifier is a value calculated from an attribute value such as STR/DEX,
e.g. if STR = 12, STR modifier = (STR-10)/2, i.e. 1 OR if STR = 6, modifier = (6-10)/2 = -2
An attribute of 10 is considered average (gives a 0 modifier), i.e. what a normal character would have.
-as noted throughout above - some steps are intentionally ignored to keep this combat implementation simple
-all weapons regardless of stats will do d6() (between 1 and 6) damage - to be finished

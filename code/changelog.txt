Shadows Rising RPG 0.0.4b (patched)
-----------------------------------

Tuesday, November 2, 2004
	-THEME: altered the main game theme to reflect the Q-Site theme "Deep Blue". Pages now appear in a modular format - hopefully easier on the eyes :)
	-DATABASE: class table updated

Monday, November 1, 2004
	-FIXED: a rendering of the MapGen editing page in IE showed a double-margin space at the bottom of selected tiles after they were selected. This "double-margin on DIV layers" is a KNOWN BUG in IE and has been resolved by adding to the altered DIV layer an extra style=> display: inline; not required by more compliant browsers.

	-ADDED: mapgen.php - aims to enable user design/editing of terrain maps
	-CVS: initial commit of mapgen.php and templates

	-CVS: 0.0.4 committed to SF
	-CVS: loginfo CVSROOT edited to enable automated mailings of all commits to shadowsrising-developers mailing list on SF

Saturday, October 23, 2004 (from October 9)
	-Complete reworking of Q-CMS (now renamed Q-Site) - this composes Q-Site 0.2
	-Database: Some extensive database reworking, mainly updating Q-Site tables, adding combat/creatures
	-Fixed: Bugs 1009963, 959364, 958701 (see referenced Bugs on sf.net)
	-all classes ported to new /core/classes/ directory
	-Install Utility updated to 0.2 (to be merged with Q-Site) - now fully templated
	-db_funcs.inc.php now uses include_once rather than require_once on config.inc.php, this prevents the script terminating when starting installation - i.e. when config file does not yet exist
	-directory detection in install.php updated to prevent directories including the /install/ directory as base
	-simple combat engine implemented in /core/classes/combat.class.php
	-small rand based encounters added to /core/includes/location.inc.php
	-Anti-Cheat System implemented, blocks player from all uri_requests except those developers explicitly approve from within each PHP script. Additional anti cheat measures to be added
	-See above - using non-approved uri results in player being directed to a reconstructed version of the prior page they visited
	-Templating: repeating HTML sections in templates ported to /templates/blocks/ directory
	-Small changes to login process - a full review is scheduled to try simplifying the process some more - less steps = less potential for errors!

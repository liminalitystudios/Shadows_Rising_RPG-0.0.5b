The "Talisman War" is a free-form sequence written RPG started on the Yahoo! Groups "Fantasy Fiction World" group in 1999. The RP takes place in a world called "Nemedia" the home to a number of races who fled Earth approximately 5000 years in the past. Time is the present day, circa 2000AD Earth time, or circa 5000AE (after exile) Nemedia time. 

In contrast to Earth, Nemedia is a world where magic is commonplace and treated with a similar attitude as Humans treat science on Earth. Technology does exist, though in a far less developed state than on Earth - nevertheless the use of magic has enabled some so-called "Mystech" to approach and in some limited cases surpass Earth technology. Economies remain largely agriculture based. Forms of rule vary widely between races from Dictatorships and Monarchies to more open forms such as the Elven Triumvirate. A number of races retain a traditional tribal or clan based form of rule - keeping power diluted from any single individual.

Classes (sample of 18 - pick 10 for alpha)
======================


Magic Wielding (structured)
---------------------------

Wizard
Mage
Magician
Spellcaster
Sorceror


Magical Wielding (clerical)
---------------------------

Druid
Shaman
Priest
Healer

Notes: overlap to be expected, but broadly correct? Structured classes require lengthy training and experience - normally congregate in organisations and specialise in several magic techniques. Clerical classes have some natural ability, an affinity for their environment due to racial, or personal attitudes - usually highly empathic/independent with a high respect for Deitys and/or racial values.

Fighter Based
-------------

Soldier
Warrior
Paladin
Mercenary


Profession Based
----------------

Thief
Bounty Hunter
Elite Guardian / Peacekeeper (think Cops...)
Gambler (a professional occupation!)
Corporation Official (okay, so I'm out of ideas...)

Skills

Skills are very generic and hence not listed. Suffice it to say a very close look at D&D D20 will provide most of these...but not all. There will be certain balancing or additional skills to cover certain abilities available in the game not covered by D&D.
